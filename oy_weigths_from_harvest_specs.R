# in reality, it ends up being pretty odd - deep water flatfish ends up being some of the highest "value" stocks 
# part of the reason is that TAC=ABC for many stocks, including non-target stocks
# this is because there is no constraining cap in the GOA at present so managers tend to not worry about rescaling ABC for much of the flatfish - attainment is so low anyway
# so use the attainment metric instead
